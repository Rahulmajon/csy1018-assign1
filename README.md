A great acknowledgement to my tutor, Liz Coulter-Smith who has been of great help with this project in helping understanding the core funcionalities of website development and 
styling.
also to my younger sibling, Yashna Sarah John who helped with the images involved and also bringing out the good and flaws in me so that i could format my personal history
and interests.
my bestfriend, Tonieka Haughton for staying up and putting up with me as I focused on this project day and night, trying to edit it to the maximum and put through a good effort.




                                                               Time


The actual amount of time involved in creating this project was between 15-20 hours, which was well divided through the term weeks as initally the web pages were
created and the the css page for styling was created alongside it.
