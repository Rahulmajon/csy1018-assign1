A great acknowledgement to my tutor, Liz Coulter-Smith who has been of great help with this project in helping understanding the core functionalities of website development and styling and also to my younger sibling, Yashna Sarah John who helped with the images involved and also bringing out the good and flaws in me so that I could format my personal history and interests. And to my best friend, Tonieka Haughton for staying up and putting up with me as I focused on this project day and night, trying to edit it to the maximum and put through a good effort.
